# Project: Can you recognize the emotion from an image of a face?

### Doc folder

The doc directory contains all the different main files used to extract features from the data sets, implement, train cross validate and test the models. 

Only the main.Rmd file is used to generate and train the best model selected to implement the facial emotion recognition algorithm. All the other files are additional files that were not picked in the final selection, but which represent the implementation and work of team members.
