### A Note on Contributions

Project 3

Team members: Weiwei Song, Aurore Gosmant, Zi Fang, Changhao He, Jimmy Smiley

Summary: In this project, we developed a new method and improved the classification accuracy for images of cats and dogs to 99.9%

[Contribution Statement] 
Weiwei Song implemented several algorithms counting XGBoost, XGBoost+SMOTE, Random Forest algorithms. She is also responsible for writing the related .Rmd and R script files, and preparing the slides for the class presentation.

Aurore Gosmant is responsible for exploring through the data and the features generated by the fiducial points. She also implemented the PCA + XGBoost algorithm, tuned hyperparameters, ran cross validation and generated the .Rmd and .R script files corresponding.

Zi Fang implemented and tuned the PCA + Linear Discriminant Analysis and KNN algorithms, and generated the associated .Rmd and .R scripts corresponding. She also worked on XGBoost cooperatively with Weiwei Song.

Changhao He is responsible for implementing and running the baseline model, tuning hyper parameters. He wrote the R files about the baseline model and finalized the main.Rmd. He also ran the best model on the test data given in class.
