The lib repository contains all the scripts needed to train, test and cross validate the models used for facial emotion recognition.

Only the cross_validation.R, train.R and test.R files are used to generate and train the best model selected to implement the facial emotion recognition algorithm. All the other files are additional files that were not picked in the final selection, but which represent the implementation and work of team members.
